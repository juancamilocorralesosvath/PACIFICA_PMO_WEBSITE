          <h3>Committed to creating a sustainable future</h3>
          <p>Sustainability is a critical business focus, and sustainable project management requires looking at 
            projects in a whole new way. For too long, project managers have worked on their projects as if 
            they were islands, unrelated to organizational strategy and governance and unrelated to the 
            community at large. Putting project management in the correct strategic context helps project 
            managers and teams make the right decisions for their projects, for their company, and for society 
            at large.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3>Awesome title here</h3>
        <p>Project managers need to be fiscally sustainable—they manage time and budget —as well as 
            socially and environmentally sustainable—they manage resources. However, sustainability isn't 
            just being “green,” and being aware of our impact on the environment. We also need to evaluate
            the risks related to labor practices, human rights, fair business dealings, and consumer issues. 
            We, in Pacifica PMO, integrate sustainability into your own project management practices and 
            guide your company toward sustainability. One project managers CAN make a difference!</p>

        <h3>Awesome title here x2</h3>
        <p>Sustainability in Pacifica PMO is an approach to business that balances the environmental, social, 
            economic aspects of project-based working to meet the current needs of stakeholders without 
            compromising or overburdening future generations.
            We take into account the following six factors: we optimize the current use of fossil fuels, 
            eliminate waste, recycle, recover energy, save time, and reduce, or eliminate, pollution in all our 
            projects.
            These all sound great, but you can tell that they have more to do with profits and appearance than 
            environmentalism.</p>
