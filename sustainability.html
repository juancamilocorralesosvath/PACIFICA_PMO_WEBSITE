            <p style="margin-bottom: 50px;" >Sustainability is a critical business focus, and sustainable project management requires looking at 
              projects in a whole new way. For too long, project managers have worked on their projects as if 
              they were islands, unrelated to organizational strategy and governance and unrelated to the 
              community at large. Putting project management in the correct strategic context helps project 
              managers and teams make the right decisions for their projects, for their company, and for society 
              at large.</p>

            <p>Project managers need to be fiscally sustainable—they manage time and budget —as well as 
              socially and environmentally sustainable—they manage resources. However, sustainability isn't 
              just being “green,” and being aware of our impact on the environment. We also need to evaluate
              the risks related to labor practices, human rights, fair business dealings, and consumer issues. 
              We, in Pacifica PMO, integrate sustainability into your own project management practices and 
              guide your company toward sustainability. One project managers <strong> CAN </strong> make a difference!</p>

        <h1>Creating balance</h1>
        <p>Sustainability in Pacifica PMO is an approach to business that balances the environmental, social, 
            economic aspects of project-based working to meet the current needs of stakeholders without 
            compromising or overburdening future generations.
            We take into account the following six factors: we optimize the current use of fossil fuels, 
            eliminate waste, recycle, recover energy, save time, and reduce, or eliminate, pollution in all our 
            projects.
            These all sound great, but you can tell that they have more to do with profits and appearance than 
            environmentalism.</p>

              <p>There is a reason that climate change appears first on so many lists about sustainability. Climate 
                change is perhaps the greatest crisis affecting our planet today. It stems from one major cause, 
                namely, the gradual warming of the planet due to greenhouse gases produced by the burning 
                of fossil fuels.
                The results of it are a shift in climate and weather patterns across the globe. Devastating wildfires, 
                frequent, destructive tropical storms, heretofore unseen heat waves, and rising sea levels are just 
                a taste of the destructive power of climate change. What does all this have to do with 
                sustainability, you ask? As always, the onus for fixing the current trend is put upon us, humanity.
                We caused the problem to begin with, so the only way to truly fix it is to shift away from destructive 
                and dwindling fossil fuels to something more sustainable. These things could be renewable forms 
                of energy or electric/hybrid vehicles.</p>

              <p>Environmental sustainability might be defined as how well we preserve the sanctity of our 
                environment. This could mean developing more sustainable methods of procuring and using 
                tangible natural resources like wood, metal, or water, as well as more ephemeral resources like 
                electricity. This factor is all about moderation as a species. We need to curb our unchecked 
                consumption of natural resources in order to be more sustainable.

              <p>Human nature does not intrinsically allow us to be sustainable, but that does not mean that it is 
                not within our power to be so. If we, as individuals, do not strive for sustainability, if we cannot 
                admit that we are accountable as stewards for our planet, then true sustainability will never be 
                achieved. We must learn how to feed, clothe, and entertain ourselves using sustainable means or

                Things like eating a more sustainable diet and engaging in sustainable and ethical 
                farming practices are forms of ethical sustainability. In terms of business, it might mean being 
                more transparent about the unsustainable parts of operations and amending them to be more

                be technological, they can be philosophical or socioeconomic. We need to change the way we see

              <p>Sustainability through technology has been our saving grace in recent years. Many countries have 
                already begun to adopt new renewable technologies on a grand scale, replacing antiquated and 
                polluting methods of energy production. According to the Iowa Agricultural Literacy Foundation, 
                some companies have begun adopting new agricultural technological advances to help grow crops 
                and use fewer resources.
                It’s a sign that things are changing for the better, but worldwide adoption needs to happen for our 
                species to be truly sustainable. At the same time, technologies and practices must continue to 
                improve.</p>
